		<h2>Scares Scrambler (2017-2020)</h2>
		<div class="projectDiv">
			<img src="../assets/projects/ScaresScrambler.png" alt="Scares Scrambler screenshot" class="projectImg">
			<span class="projectBlurb">
				The Scares Scrambler is an open-source Python application which takes the data/code of any 
				file and "scrambles" it using various user-controlled algorithms. The program is intended for
				creating experimental artwork of preexisting images, audio, game files, etc. 
				<br><br>
				The Scares Scrambler was built as a replacement to the aging Vinesauce ROM Corrupter, another 
				program with similar features. The app has since become the de facto cross-platform
				corrupting application by virtue of Python's portability (compared to bigger apps like
				the Real Time Corrupter, which are exclusive to Windows).

		<h2>Pantheon Wiki (2022)</h2>
		<div class="projectDiv">
			<img src="../assets/projects/PantheonWiki.png" alt="Pantheon Wiki screenshot" class="projectImg">
			<span class="projectBlurb">
				Pantheon Wiki is a Vue app for displaying fictional character data retrieved from a MongoDB
				database using a NodeJS web server. The project was made for a Web-Centric Programming class, 
				where the the relevant tools and languages were learned in a few weeks. All the art and
				writings on the site can easily be swapped for different data by changing the JSON data
				hosted on the database.
				<br><br>
				The wiki supports full CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) functionality, with a simple
				page editor/creator built into the site. The NodeJS server also supports RESTful API calls,
				with a Postman collection included with the source code for easy testing with one's own data.

		<h2>Centralised University Booking System (CUBS) (2024)</h2>
		<div class="projectDiv">
			<img src="../assets/projects/CUBS.png" alt="CUBS screenshot" class="projectImg">
			<span class="projectBlurb">
				CUBS is a simple MySQL/PHP/JS database application for booking public spaces on a university
				campus. It allows users to view and book available spaces by interacting with a
				dynamically-created week-by-week timetable. It has a simple account system for managing the
				permissions of various people who may use such a system (e.g. students, staff, admins).
				<br><br>
				This project was created as part of a Database Management Systems class, and as such, the
				development of CUBS followed the standard DBMS development cycle. Requirements analysis was
				conducted to determine the project's required functionality, DB schema were created and
				refined, and multiple presentations were held with potential users of the system during
				development to guide and inform progress.

		<h2>LINCELLAUT and ORBITVIS (2022-2024)</h2>
		<div class="projectDiv">
			<img src="../assets/projects/ORBITVIS.png" alt="ORBITVIS screenshot" class="projectImg">
			<span class="projectBlurb">
				LINCELLAUT and ORBITVIS are two open-source programs created to explore the dynamics of
				finite linear cellular automata (think Conway's Game of Life but with stricter rules).
				<br><br>
				LINCELLAUT is a collection of CLI tools written in C to automate various computations and
				searches. It includes an arbitrary integer precision unit, functions for dealing with
				matrices, vectors, and polynomials, and documentation.
				<br><br>
				ORBITVIS is a Pygame app used to visualise various orbits and data generated by LINCELLAUT. 
				It features multiple different visualisation methods and makes use of LINCELLAUT's C codebase
				for fast renders.

		<h2>Raycode (2024)</h2>
		<div class="projectDiv">
			<img src="../assets/projects/raycode.png" alt="Raycode render" class="projectImg">
			<span class="projectBlurb">
				Raycode is a simple MATLAB application that implements ray marching to render basic shapes.
				The code was written in such a way as to be easily understandable by anyone looking to
				learn about how ray marching works. This project was created for a Numerical Methods 
				class. On the <a href="./writings.html" target="_blank">Writings</a> page,
				check out the accompanying write-up, <a href="../books/AFriendlyIntroductionToRayMarching.pdf" target="_blank">
				A Friendly Introduction to Ray Marching</a>!
				<br><br>
				On top of the basic ray marching algorithm, other mathematical algorithms were implemented
				including point diffuse lighting, modular arithmetic (for infinitely-repeating shapes),
				and signed distance function distortions.

		<h2>Sharks (2025)</h2>
		<div class="projectDiv">
			<img src="../assets/projects/sharks.png" alt="Sharks screenshot" class="projectImg">
			<span class="projectBlurb">
				Sharks is a Unity 6 implementation of the card game <emph>Wizard</emph>. The game was
				created as part of a Game Development course and was a group effort. Valuable experience
				was gained developing with a team, using GitHub Desktop to manage a shared repo, and 
				planning/structuring how a game will be implemented before doing any coding. It was
				also an exercise in distributing responsibilitiesâ€”programming, art, and planning/presentation
				were split among the group's four members.
				<br><br>
				The majority of the group had no experience using Unity before this project. Over four months,
				the Sharks group not only learned Unity (and C#) independently, but also put together a 
				fully functional game using the engine.

				site was designed and programmed from scratch!

				This site was created with responsive design in mind. Larger screens display a
				traditional horizontal navigation bar at the top of each page, while smaller screens
				utilise a mobile-friendly sidebar.
