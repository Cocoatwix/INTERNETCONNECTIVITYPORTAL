      <h1>Videos</h1>
      <p>
				I've been making content online for a pretty long time! Since then, I've accumulated
				a moderately large backlog of videos, most of which are on 
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/scares009" target="_blank">
				YouTube.
				</a>
				Below, I've listed some of my favourites, my most ambitious, and my most successful.
			</p>
			<p>
				If any of these videos spark your interest, consider supporting me on YouTube! I'm
				also open to editing commissions; 
				<a href="mailto:cocoatwix@hotmail.com">
					shoot me an email
				</a>
				if there's a project you'd like to start with me!

					and creating something new from it. This "something" could be comical,
					story-driven, abstract, etc. I opted for all three of these. The result was an
					experiment in unconventional storytelling presented through preexisting media.
					I learned several new editing techniques and became familiar with a few new tools
					through this video.

					This one is likely the best in terms of quality; I had become quite familiar with
					the program at this point, both in terms of usage and customisation. While this video
					doesn't showcase my editing capabilities, it does demonstrate my comprehension of
					visual design and my ability to learn and use multiple pieces of software to create
					videos (and more generally, visual art).

					demonstration of my ability to craft meaningful stories.

					<em>crushing things with a car gets you views</em> is my most recent commentary-style
					video. These videos are some of my favourite to produce as they challenge me in a 
					number of ways. The videos require a comprehensive review and critique of the content
					in question, an engaging narrative, and succinct editing. I'm also proud of the seamless 
					live-action segments at the beginning and end, which feature an animated hexagon character
					edited in alongside me.

					<em>The BIOS Corruption Collab</em> was a collaboration I hosted with several other
					content creators online. Participants showcased their unique "BIOS Corruptions", the
					results of taking video game console files and scrambling their code. The entries can
					range from pretty comical to downright eerie. This video was the result of a lot of
					dedication from me and everyone who joined, and I'm glad I was able to encourage so
					many people to try their hand at experimental art creation!

					<em>memories of mobius</em> is a track from my 2020 EP

						"remains of Z".

					The music video was created using recontextualised clips from Mark Haynes' animation series
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zkGU3-OVI" target="_blank">
						Super Mario Bros. Z,
					</a>
					where the EP's samples originate from. The music video exists in a limbo between existential 
					dread and deliberate insincerity. It's not sure whether it wants to invoke bittersweet
					memories of one's childhood, or elicit laughter from its overdramatic portrayal of a Mario 
					and Sonic fan animation. Maybe they're one of the same.
