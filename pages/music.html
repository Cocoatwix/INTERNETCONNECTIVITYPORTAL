				<a href="https://tvaaas.bandcamp.com/album/u">U by TVAAAS, suri</a>
			</iframe>
			<span class="musicBlurb">
				Over the years, I've found myself becoming more and more like other people. In a world that's 
				more connected than any other time in history, it's almost impossible not to let others influence
				how you think about yourself, how you conduct yourself, and even who you want to be. <em>U</em> 
				is an album that explores that influence. It's an amalgamation of the sounds and ideas that have
				accumulated within me over the past few years. Is my assimilation into a broader culture a good
				thing? Is it a threat to my individuality? I feel it's a mix of both.

				<a href="https://tvaaas.bandcamp.com/album/cobequid">
					Cobequid by TVAAAS
				</a>
			</iframe>
			<span class="musicBlurb">
				<em>Cobequid</em> is an album about transitions. As I started university during the COVID-19
				pandemic, I was forced to guinea-pig an environment filled with poor connections, daily masquerades,
				and ration lines. These circumstances led to me experiencing some of the most inexplicable, 
				draining emotions of my life, emotions that I'm still trying to make sense of. <em>Cobequid</em>
				was my attempt at encapsulating some of these transient emotions, channelling the raw confusion, angst, 
				dejection, and listlessness that came with confronting and recovering from a nation-wide emergency. 
				The album crashes through various sounds, mimicking the waves of my disposition, disregarding cohesion 
				in exchange for authenticity.

					Digital Abyss by TVAAAS, pussanpuss, post, LS
				</a>
			</iframe>
			<span class="musicBlurb">
				<em>Digital Abyss</em> is, at its core, a look into the fragmentation of humanity with
				regards to modern technology. The Internet has done a lot to bring us together, but it has
				also split us apart. Communities arise from communities, ideologies mutate in
				isolated echo chambers, discontentment grows from negative media, barriers form by way
				of jargon. The album sees the world succumbing to its own devices, the devices which 
				promised utopia a few decades ago. It predicts a metaphorical flood of our own misinformation, 
				and a literal flood from our abandon to the world. Three acts, told through obscure, boisterous,
				outrageous sampling.

					remains of Z by TVAAAS
				</a>
			</iframe>
			<span class="musicBlurb">
				<em>remains of Z</em> is an unwanted look back on my childhood, told through the
				sounds of Mark Haynes'
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zkGU3-OVI" target="_blank">
					Super Mario Bros. Z.
				</a>
				We often look back on our childhoods quite fondly, remembering old friends or
				old places. For me, I just as often look back and recall things I regret doing,
				words I regret saying, and people I regret befriending. These bad memories, despite
				being unwelcome, have good memories entangled within them. A bad argument leads to a
				good change, a good intention leads to a bad outcome. It's not always as straightforward
				to characterise events as one thinks. The only way to reconcile yourself is to confront
				yourself, no matter what you may throw at yourself.

					Sun Outage 2020 by TVAAAS
				</a>
			</iframe>
			<span class="musicBlurb">
				<em>Sun Outage 2020</em> is a romanticisation of weather forecasts, the atmosphere
				they present, and the time period with which they're associated. Weather forecasts are
				ubiquitous in many of our lives; in some ways our actions are controlled by them. Some
				of my fondest memories sport local forecast music in the background. Weather forecasts
				are also bearers of tragedy, telling of natural disasters and ongoing climate and diversity
				crises. But the forecast itself remains unphased, continuing its smooth jazz, shuffling right 
				on to the next region. There isn't anything quite like the hypnagogic stupor of watching The
				Weather Network late at night, numbing yourself to the stories and alerts, and letting the
				blue seas and white clouds guide you to sleep. This album attempts to capture these emotions.
